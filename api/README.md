#DCmd RESTful API

##Overview
This page outlines the details of the RESTful API that is in development for DCmd. Currently, we have deployed an API for interacting with Host entities primarily. It should be relatively fast to duplicate efforts for other entities.

##Security
Security for the API is accomplished by IP-based filtering. Please contact DCmd for access to the API

This page is to be updated later. For now, please refer to the [confluence page](https://www.hawaii.edu/bwiki/display/SITARd/RESTful+API)
